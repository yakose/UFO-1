* Lack of reliable data from credible sources
  We agree, we have no sources to our claims

* Theoretical Explanations are present but could be more elaborate
  We do agree we could change a few lines for more clarity
  We disagree because the reviewer seems to not have read the paragraph

* Previous Work / Future Work discussion is missing
  We ran out of space in our 4 page limit and we had some trouble finding good examples

* Design Criteria, Sample Calculations and Simulations
  We will attempt to make an experiment that supports our claims but we do not know
  exactly how to integrate it

* Design Constraints and Ass+umptions
  Graphs, we agree

* Overview - exceeds expectations
** What could we have done better ??
**************** we don't know please help
		 Yes

   Make the presentation seperate to the 'report'

** 1 - Integration Tests
   Examples ?
   Experiments

    Pictures
    Something to catch the reader
    'Sexy'
    Heavy to read
    Information on what worked
    No experiment
    No information about the project
    Bad conclusion
    Hypethesis is also the conclusion
