# Microservices vs Monolith

## Notes
- Size of project
- Time spent building architecture
- Security and logging
- Shared memory
- Tightly vs Loosely coupled
- Scalability
- Docker
- Set up criteria for why you think microservices are better than monoliths
- What is my preference, are there others with the same opinion and why do I prefer this?

## Abstract
- What is the problem?  
  Monoliths are bad for scalability and hard to main old features, because it's tightly coupled.  

- Why is this interesting for us?  
  If you have the wrong architecture it can hurt your development process and performance of your application.

- What does your solution achieve?  
  Implementing a Microservices architecture will allow you to scale the system easily and maintain the existing code with more ease.

- What follows from your solution?  
  Can result in a better workflow, but is more expensive.
  Microservices are harder to implement, meaning in a smaller project it can be harmful because it will take a lot of work to setup the environment. Some tools have surfaced to help solving this issue but still takes time to setup the entire production environment.

## Outline of project
- Outlining the problem
- Monoliths and microservices explained
- Pro and Cons for each of the above
- When do these pros and cons apply?
- When do I choose a monolithic architecture over microservices? (conclusion)
