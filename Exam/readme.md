# Microservices vs Monolith

## Notes
- Size of project
- Time spent building architecture
- Security and logging
- Shared memory
- Tightly vs Loosely coupled
- Scalability
- Docker


## Abstract
- What isis the problem  
  Monoliths are bad for scalability and hard to implement new features and maintaining because it's tightly coupled  

- Why is this interesting for us  
  If you have the wrong architecture it can hurt your development process

- Solution  
  implementing Microservices will allow you to scale the system easily and maintain the existing code with more ease.

- Following Solution  
  Better workflow

  Microservices are harder to implement, meaning in a smaller project it can be harmful because it will take a lot of work to setup the environment. Some tools have surfaced to help solving this issue but still takes time to setup the entire production environment.

## Outline of project
- Outlining the problem
- Monoliths and microservices explained
- Pro and Cons for each of the above
- When do these pros and cons apply?
- When do I choose a monolithic structure over microservices? (conclusion)
